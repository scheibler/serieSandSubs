A to do list

1.
At the moment, only .srt subtitles are supported
other subtitle formats could be converted into the .srt format with the following mplayer command:
mplayer -dumpsrtsub -sub subtitle_filename
not tested yet

2.
Create a setup script for an easier installation
Maybe also a Debian package
