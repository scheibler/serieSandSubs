serieSandSubs
===============

Description
-----------

This program has three main functions:
* subtitle distribution
* series management
* memorize the playback position of the media files

1. Subtitle distribution
This was the main reason why I created the program. Cause I can't read the movie and series subtitles I searched for a possibility to make them accessible.
The best solution for that seems to send the subtitles via XMPP. So it's possible to receive them by any device which can handle the XMPP protocol.
You must create at least two accounts: one for the sender and another for the recipient and enter their data into the serieSandSubs.conf file in the config folder.

I receive the subs with my iPhone and the app IM+. This app works great with the screen reader VoiceOver. The incoming messages are spoken automatically.
At the moment you need .srt subtitle files as source. For german subs I can recommend www..subcentral.de

2. Series manager
The program memorizes the currently watched episode of a series so it's not longer necessary to guess, if you already watched episode 10 or not. If you start it without any parameters, it lists all resumable series.
But a series must be added by hand. To do this you use the parameter "-a" and then enter the first episode file name.

3. Regardless if it's a series or not the system will memorize the playback position of all media files. So it's easy to resume a half watched video or audio book. This is done automatically when you start the playback again. If you want to play the file from beginning, use the -f parameter.

The other file in the config menu named input.conf does not directly belong to my program. It's a MPlayer config file where the user can  specify shortcuts for for MPlayer functions.
I defined:
* s: to jump between audio streams if more than one is available (often used to change the language)
* n: to set the playback speed back to normal (can be changed with [] and {})
